# Cardiovascular Disease dataset
## Data Overview
Cardiovascular disease is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. And are the leading cause of death worldwide by representing 32% of all global deaths, which is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.
Through this project we want to build a model to predict the patient's condition based on many features related to the patient.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 13 features and 70,000 observations.

Below is a description of the features:
