## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. And are the leading cause of death worldwide by representing 32% of all global deaths, which is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.


## Purpose:
The goal of this project is to build machine learning models to classify or identify patient's condition on Cardiovascular Disease based medical examination for the patient.


## Data Description
The dataset consists of 13 features and 70,000 observations.

Below is a description of the features: 

| Feature name  | Description   | Data type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| id            | unique number | int64         |
| age           | patient's age in days| int64       |
| gender        | women or men  | int64         |
| height        | patient's height (cm)| int64         |
| weight        | patient's weight (kg)| float64       |
| ap_hi         | Systolic blood pressure | int64      |
| ap_lo         | Diastolic blood pressure | int64 |
| cholesterol   | Cholesterol level in the patient's body | int64 |
| gluc          | The patient's body glucose level | int64 |
| smoke         | patient smokes or not | int64 |
| alco          | Alcohol intake | int64 |
| active        | Physical activity | int64 |
| cardio        | Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | int64 |
